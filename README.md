# LITERALLY 1984

LITERALLY 1984 is a Discord bot
created by the DT Code Club
to keep watch for profanity in its Discord server.
Upon detecting a message that contains words
matched by the configurable blacklist,
it will send a warning to the message author
and report the message to the server admins.

LITERALLY 1984 is extremely simple,
written under fifty lines of Node.js source code,
with no dependencies other than [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).
